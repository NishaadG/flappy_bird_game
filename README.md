Flappy Dash – A weird kind of Flappy Bird game I made for my Programming Laboratory Final Project (Semester 2).

Most of the files are me trying to understand the concepts which I finally implemented in my project , newgame.c contains the final product of the game and devcppcompatiblegame.c contains the Dev Cpp version of the game.

Description:
Flappy Dash is a fast-paced, console-based arcade game where players control a character (represented by $) navigating through a tunnel of moving walls. The player must dodge incoming barriers with only a small gap to pass through, using WASD keys to move up, down, left, or right. The walls continuously shift from right to left, and the game gets progressively harder as the player’s score increases. The player's goal is to survive as long as possible while accumulating points for each wall successfully avoided.
