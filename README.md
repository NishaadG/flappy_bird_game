# flappy_bird_game
A weird kind of flappy bird game I made for my Programming Laboratory Final Project Semester-2

Most of the files are me trying to understand the concepts which I finally implemented in my project , newgame.c contains the final product of the game and devcppcompatiblegame.c contains the Dev Cpp version of the game.
